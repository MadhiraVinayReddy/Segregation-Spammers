Smartphones present a number of security and privacy
concerns that are, in many respects, even more alarming
than those existing in traditional computing environments
[1]. Most smartphone platforms are equipped with
multiple sensors that can determine user location, gestures,
moves and other physical activities, to name a few.
Smartphones also feature high-quality audio and video
recording capabilities. Sensitive pieces of information
that can be captured by these devices could be easily
leaked by malware residing on the smartphone. Even
apparently harmless capabilities have swiftly turned
into a potential menace.
